### Year Toggle Mechanism

The year toggle now uses a reliable mechanism that:
- Properly shows/hides the appropriate team containers
- Updates button active states correctly
- Uses direct DOM manipulation with !important flags to override any conflicting styles
- Includes console logging for debugging

### Profile Card Styling

Profile cards now feature:
- Consistent dimensions (280px Ã— 360px)
- Properly positioned captions that appear on hover
- Smooth hover transitions with scale effects for images
- Gradient backgrounds for better text readability
- Proper z-indexing to avoid overlay issues

### Browser Compatibility

The enhancements are designed to work across modern browsers with:
- Fallback mechanisms for older browsers
- Direct style application via JavaScript for maximum compatibility
- Multiple approaches to ensure visibility (classes, inline styles, !important flags)

## Future Maintenance

When making changes to the Meet The Board page in the future:

1. **For Adding New Team Members**:
   - Follow the existing HTML structure in the team containers
   - Use the same profile card structure with proper class names
   - Ensure images are properly sized and cropped

2. **For Styling Changes**:
   - Consider using !important flags if needed to override existing styles
   - Test both teams (2024 and 2025) when making changes
   - Check all hover states and interactions

3. **For Adding New Years**:
   - Duplicate the existing team container structure
   - Update the year toggle buttons
   - Follow the id naming convention ("team2026", etc.)

These enhancements provide a solid foundation for the Meet The Board page, ensuring reliable functionality and a modern, appealing design.
