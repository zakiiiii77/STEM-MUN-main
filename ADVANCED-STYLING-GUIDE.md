## Overview

The Meet The Board page has been enhanced with modern, cutting-edge design techniques including:

- 3D perspective transformations
- Advanced CSS animations
- Interactive hover effects
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Particle and parallax effects
- Dynamic content transitions
- Interactive UI elements

These enhancements create a premium, immersive experience while maintaining performance and compatibility across devices.

## 3D Card Effects

### Profile Cards

The profile cards feature advanced 3D transformations:

- Perspective-based 3D space (`perspective: 1000px`)
- 3D preserved transformations (`transform-style: preserve-3d`)
- Dynamic tilt effects responding to mouse position
- Depth-enhanced shadows that change on interaction
- Clipped image containers with angled edges
- Z-index layering for proper depth perception

### Tilt Effect Implementation

The cards respond to mouse movement with a dynamic tilt effect that creates the illusion of physicality:

```javascript
function handleTilt(e) {
    const card = this;
    const cardRect = card.getBoundingClientRect();
    const cardCenterX = cardRect.left + cardRect.width / 2;
    const cardCenterY = cardRect.top + cardRect.height / 2;
    const angleX = (e.clientY - cardCenterY) / 15;
    const angleY = (cardCenterX - e.clientX) / 15;
    
    card.style.transform = `translateY(-20px) rotateX(${angleX}deg) rotateY(${angleY}deg)`;
}
```

## Advanced Animations

### Title Effects

The main title features several advanced techniques:

- Character-by-character animation with staggered delays
- Text gradient with animated position (`background-position`)
- Dynamic glow effect that follows mouse movement
- Custom decorative elements with entrance animations

### Floating Effect

Cards have a subtle floating animation that creates a sense of lightness:

```css
@keyframes float {
    0% { transform: translateY(0px); }
    50% { transform: translateY(-10px); }
    100% { transform: translateY(0px); }
}
```

This is combined with staggered animation delays based on card index to create a wave-like effect across multiple cards.

### Particle Background

The page features dynamically generated particle elements that:

- Are created at random positions
- Have varying sizes and opacities
- Float upward at different speeds
- Are continuously regenerated to maintain the effect

## Scroll Effects

### Scroll-Triggered Animations

Elements animate into view as they enter the viewport:

- Headings zoom in from a smaller size
- Cards slide in from alternating directions
- Opacity transitions create a fade-in effect
- Animation timing is staggered using CSS transitions

### Implementation

The scroll reveal system uses the following approach:

1. Add appropriate classes to elements (`scroll-reveal`, `reveal-left`, etc.)
2. Track scroll position through scroll event listeners
3. Calculate element positions relative to the viewport
4. Add a `revealed` class when elements should be visible
5. Use CSS transitions to handle the actual animation

### Scroll Progress Indicator

A progress bar at the top of the page shows how far the user has scrolled:

```javascript
function updateScrollProgress() {
    const windowScroll = document.documentElement.scrollTop || document.body.scrollTop;
    const height = document.documentElement.scrollHeight - document.documentElement.clientHeight;
    const scrolled = (windowScroll / height) * 100;
    
    progressBar.style.width = scrolled + '%';
}
```

## Interactive Elements

### Year Toggle Buttons

The year toggle buttons feature:

- Subtle hover effects with background transitions
- Active state with gradient background
- Border animation on hover
- Ripple effect on click for tactile feedback

### Social Media Icons

Social icons in the profile cards have:

- Scale and elevation change on hover
- Color transition
- Shadow enhancement
- Coordinated animation with the card caption

### Scroll-to-Top Button

The fixed scroll-to-top button:

- Appears when scrolling down
- Features hover animation
- Includes smooth scrolling behavior
- Has a custom arrow icon with transitions

## Performance Considerations

To maintain performance while implementing these advanced effects:

1. **Hardware Acceleration**: Using transform and opacity for animations
2. **Throttled Events**: Scroll events are optimized
3. **CSS Transitions**: Using CSS rather than JavaScript where possible
4. **Efficient Selectors**: Minimizing DOM queries
5. **Animation Cleanup**: Removing unnecessary animations when not visible

## Browser Compatibility

These enhancements use modern CSS and JavaScript features with appropriate fallbacks:

- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Use of vendor prefixes where needed
- Fallback styles for browsers without 3D transform support
- Detection and adaptation for mobile devices
